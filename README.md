Below is a detailed objective:
1. Analyse the musical positiveness of her albums/songs over the years. Analyse trend lines w.r.t her vocabulary, danceability and other metrics over the years

## Conclusion
In part one of our analysis, we notice that she is highly ranked amongst the critics across all her albums. Although we notice the diversity in valence across her songs, most of her songs have been sad songs rather than happy ones. The danceability scores across songs have been above average which suggests that the crowd seems to be enjoying her song collection regardless of the genre of the song she sings.

In part two of our analysis, we examined the lyrics of Taylor Swift’s songs. From this analysis we can see clear differences in her latest two albums compared to all of her previous albums in terms of sentiment but also in expansion of vocabulary used by Taylor in her songs. As Taylor has matured, her output of music has also changed. What began as country music transitioned into pop and more recently into indie-folk music. This shows the diversity in her song collection that is evident in our analysis.

However across all of Taylor’s songs a strong emphasis can be seen on the theme of love and relationships with “love” being her most frequently used word of all.


In conclusion no matter what your mood Taylor’s a good shout for your next spotify search from songs to cry to after your latest heartbreak, to songs to dance around your bedroom to after achieving an excellent result in your r group project and everything in between, she has it all.
